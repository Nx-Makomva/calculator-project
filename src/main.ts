The problem?
Build a calculator using HTML, SCSS and JS / TS

NOTES:
- Deployed website using github pages
- Public github repo
- Branches 
- 15+ commits for the different stages of development
- A README.md with short intro to project
- Be responsive and built mobile-first + must work for different screen widths 


Requirements:
1. Can accept inputs
2. Do some calculations and give correct output (returns stuff)
3. Inputs come from user clicks on buttons (use button elements)

What needs to happen?
- Will need event handlers to do something after button clicks
- Will need event listeners to look out for button clicks
